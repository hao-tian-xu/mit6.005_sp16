## Software Construction

This repository shares the learning process of the course 6.005 with online materials from MIT OCW. The results are divided into the following two parts:

1. Problem sets and final project solutions (with commit history) in [this repository](https://github.com/vainField/mit6.005_sp16_pset)

   - Problem sets' solution codes are in `problemSets/ps?/src` and `test` folders.
   - The final project is in `abcplayer`.
2. Lecture notes, each with a summary titled *Thinking*
   - Including a final review (only in Chinese for now).
   - Including a reflection on the final project (only in Chinese for now).
